When a benevolent King's rule is overthrown by his scheming brother in a coup, the young prince and his soul dragon companion must embark on an epic quest to defeat the tyrant and save his parents.

You and your friend will play as the young prince and the soul dragon. Your job is to defeat all enemies and solve puzzles to save your parents. But the interesting thing is the young prince has soul eyes while his soul dragon has normal eyes. Hence, you will only be able to see the enemies that are targeting your partner. You must work closely with your partner to help them defeat the enemies they cannot see - just as they will help you!

To find out full story behind the game and the reasons why they have such eyes, please see [Storyline](#storyline)
