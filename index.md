Developed by Team Socialize for NUS CS3247: Game Development using Unity 2020.3.26f1

<img src="images/game_poster.png">

When a benevolent King's rule is overthrown by his scheming brother in a coup, the young Prince and his Soul Dragon companion must embark on an epic quest to defeat the tyrant and save his parents.

You and your friend will play as the young Prince and the Soul Dragon. Your job is to defeat all enemies and solve puzzles to save your parents. However, the interesting thing is the Prince has soul eyes while his Soul Dragon has normal eyes. Hence, each player will only be able to see the enemies that are targeting their partner. You must work closely with your partner to help them defeat the enemies they cannot see - just as they will help you!

## Requirements
- Space required: 100MB
- Platforms Supported: Windows 10, MacOS

## Creating and Joining a Room
- Upon launching the game, both players must enter a room to play the game. On the menu
screen, one player first enters a room name of their choice before clicking “Create” to create a
new room. Once the room has been created, the other player can join that room by entering the
same room name and clicking “Join”.
- Each player now has the choice of who will play as the Knight and who will play as the Dragon.
The same role cannot be chosen by both players. Once each player has chosen their role, the
“Select Level” button should now be clickable and both players may proceed to the level select
screen.
- When selecting a level, both players must agree on a level to play. Currently, only Level 1 is
available. Once both players have selected the same level, the “Start Game” button should now
be clickable and both players may start the game.
